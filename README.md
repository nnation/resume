# My Latex Resume/CV

This is a modified version of the Latex CV template provided by Adrien Friggeri with my personal info

See this link for the current pdf version: https://github.com/frazras/resume/blob/master/cv_10.pdf

Credits to Rohan Smith, he introduced me to Latex document and inspired me to create my resume using this technology. 

# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.

You may need to install the fonts on your pc if you do not have them.
